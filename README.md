### Time calculators 
Bread recipes can often take an entire day or more. Wondering if you'll have enough time to finish? Do you need to know when to start by in order to make finish in time? BreadLog has easy to use calculators for each recipe.

### Easily build steps and add ingredients 
Artisan recipes often have many steps, adding the same ingredient in varying amounts in each step. BreadLog provides an easy to use, step-by-step recipe builder with flexibility to add the same ingredient in multiple steps.
